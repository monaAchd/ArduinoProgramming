# Soil Moisture Sensor Project

## Problem Statement

Agriculturists encounter challenges when irrigating the soil, such as determining the optimal amount of water to use during this operation.

## Solution

The solution involves using a soil moisture sensor that measures the soil's moisture based on changes in electrical conductivity (resistance increases with dryness). This allows for precise monitoring of soil moisture levels.

## Materials

To implement the solution, the following materials are required:

- **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **Arduino Uno**
- **LED**


## Software Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Arduino IDE:** The official integrated development environment for Arduino programming.
  - [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Implementation

To implement the solution using Arduino and the soil moisture sensor:

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. Open the Arduino IDE.

3. Copy and paste the code from soil_moisture.ino in the Soil-Moisture-Sensor folder into the Arduino IDE.

4. Connect the soil moisture sensor and LED to the specified pins on the Arduino board as shown in the circuit diagram.

5. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
