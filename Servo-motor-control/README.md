# Servo Motor Control Project

## Introduction

Servo motors are motors that can rotate with a range of about 180Â° and maintain the desired angle of rotation relatively accurately.
Servo motors are commonly used in modeling to control mechanical systems (aircraft rudders, throttle for combustion engines, etc.), or in robotics for miniature robots, actuators, or rotary indicators.
The servo motor has 3 wires: red for power, black for Ground, and white for data transmission. Add 3 male headers to the female outputs, and connect them to the board: 5V for red, Ground for black, and pin 9 for white.

## Materials

To build and control the servo motor, you will need the following materials:

- **Servo Motor**
- **Arduino Uno**
- **Prototyping Board**

## Software Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Arduino IDE:** The official integrated development environment for Arduino programming.
  - [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Implementation

To implement the servo motor control project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Open the Arduino IDE.**

3. **Copy and Paste the Code:**

   Copy and paste the code from your project's `servo_control.ino` file into the Arduino IDE.

4. **Connect the Components:**

   Connect the servo motor to the specified pins on the Arduino Uno and the prototyping board as shown in the circuit diagram (diagram available for using one servo motor, ).

5. **Upload the Code:**

   Upload the code to the Arduino Uno board.
