# Traffic Lights Project

## Problem Statement

The absence of traffic lights can lead to accidents, some of which may be fatal.

## Solution

Traffic lights contribute to organizing traffic on the road, enhancing safety and preventing accidents.

## Materials

To implement the solution, the following materials are required:

- **Resistors**
- **Arduino Uno**
- **LEDs**

## Software Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Arduino IDE:** The official integrated development environment for Arduino programming.
  - [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Implementation

To implement the solution using Arduino and create a traffic lights simulation:

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. Open the Arduino IDE.

3. Copy and paste the code from traffic_lights.ino in the Traffic-lights folder into the Arduino IDE.

4. Connect the resistors, LEDs, and other components to the specified pins on the Arduino board as shown in the circuit diagram.

5. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
